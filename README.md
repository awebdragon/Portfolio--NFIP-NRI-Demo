# nri-demo

Part of a project I helped with for the National Flood Insurance Program, for a tool that lets users input their zipcode and discover their general flood-related risk, based on NRI's API

The fully developed version of this demo can be found on the floodsmart.gov site as of 9/2025: https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-zones-and-maps/what-is-my-flood-risk#risk-level-form
