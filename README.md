# nri-demo

Part of a project I helped with for the National Flood Insurance Program, for a tool that lets users input their zipcode and discover their general flood-related risk, based on NRI's API

The fully developed version of this demo can be found on the floodsmart.gov site as of 9/2025: https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-zones-and-maps/what-is-my-flood-risk#risk-level-form 


Thanks to my former teammate, Aaron Weidele, who did a huge chunk of the initial research and build. Though, for a lack of notes, I ended up having to redo that same research in order to further develop it, so I'll consider it co-ownership. Here's his link since it feels wrong to remove it:
